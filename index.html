        <p>
          <strong>Crocodiles</strong><strong>(family Crocodylidae)</strong> or
          <strong>true crocodiles</strong> are large semiaquatic reptiles that
          live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and
          Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to
          include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the
          alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false
          gharial (family Gavialidae) among other extinct taxa. <br />
          Although they appear similar, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial
          belong to separate biological families. The gharial, with its narrow
          snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are
          more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious
          external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having
          narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout
          compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is that the
          upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the
          teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw
          when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an
          alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into
          which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed,
          the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in
          the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth
          is the most reliable feature to define the species' family. Crocodiles
          have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate
          saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which
          are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another trait that
          separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher
          levels of aggression.
